    <h2>Mikele Silva</h2>
    <p>I'm 22, from Peru and I love videogames, listen music and play Magic the Gatheing</p>
    <p>I am married to a beautiful young woman named Valeria, we have been married for a year</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, having served in the Chile Santiago West mission during 2019-2021. My favorite scripture is found in Mosiah 27:31" 
    <p>"Yes, every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess before him. Yes, in the last day, when all men stand to be judged by him, then they will confess that he is God; and those who live without God in the world will then confess that the judgment of eternal punishment upon them is just; and they will tremble and tremble and shrink under the gaze of his all-seeing eye."</p>
