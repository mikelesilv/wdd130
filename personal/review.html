                    <h3>God of War Ragnarok</h3>
                    <p>After a wait, people were surprised that even though it is the same game formula, it feels like a totally game, although on the other hand, the story feels somewhat empty, full of repetitive missions 8/10 (draft).</p>

                    <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom</h3>
                    <p>Although it seemed impossible that it could surpass its predecessor, it did so in an incredible way and although it is the same game mode, the things it adds make visiting Hyrule different and the story is something that attracts attention because it was not thought that it would leave to have a good story but it showed the opposite that's why 10/10 (draft)</p>

                    <h3>Mario Wonder</h3>
                    <p>Although this game was presented as just another platform game, it left its mark because it seems that Nintendo listened to the fans, put things that were done before and added things that were requested such as greater difficulty, being a game that has shown an entertaining challenge both For new and old players but with a simple story it is given a 9/10 (draft)</p>
