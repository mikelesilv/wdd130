      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of the page will be to talk about video games such as reviews, comments, tips for the video game, etc. Where for now they are going to focus on three specific topics and in the future if they see that there is an interested audience, they can add more content to the page.
        Homepage:
        In this part of the page, being the first face that will be seen of the brand or company, it is intended to be something simple and that at the same time it shows the things that you can do and that you can see that the page itself is complete with information valuable and trustworthy.
        So, it will be simple at the top, in the header there will be certain buttons such as home, reviews, tips for parts of video games that are difficult to pass or secret video game things to discover with their respective steps (in this case the button would say something like tips or secrets, it remains to be seen and/or news).
        Then at the bottom there would be a large news image where you can see a news item about a recent video game with a subtitle where you can quickly read what happened.
        After that there will be three logos of the console companies which will be Play Station, Nintendo and Xbox.
        And finally, there will be some links at the bottom if you wish to contact us to report an error on the page or a possible report of an offensive or obscene comment that should be deleted from the page.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="images/playstation.png" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="images/xbox.png" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 (Reviews):
        In this part of the page, you can see in summary the rating given to the specific video games, so there will be several video games on a single page.
        If the person wanted to be able to see the more detailed review, they would click on the image or on a subtitle that can and possibly be added to each review of the video game respectively, so for people who want to see something quickly they will have it in one quick and simple way, but for those who want something more detailed, they can press the image and or assigned subtitle to see the detailed comments, but at the moment those parts of the page will not be available.
        Every effort will be made to get between six to seven reviews on the page, although it will be seen in the process.
        At the bottom of the page there will be a bar where some links will be placed, just like on the home page.

      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>News</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 (News):
        In this part of the page, as mentioned in the subtitle, you can see news, prioritizing the recent ones to the oldest ones, so there are several news items that appear daily. We will try to put five news items per page because it will be viewed according to the space. Well, the goal is to put the news in summary form, but since it is news, it is possible that it may take up more space than expected and may have to be reduced from 5 to 4, which will be seen in the process of the page.
        Likewise, since the news is in a summarized and simple way, the person can press the subtitle and/or image if one is provided to see the news in detail.
        At the bottom of the page, just like the home page and the second page, a bar will be placed where the links will be located to contact us about any possible errors on the page.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In this case there will only be two accesses to the entries of the subpages which will be the part at the beginning and the part at the bottom.
      </p>

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
